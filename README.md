# Cat and Dog Classifier Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, using deep learning techniques to accurately distinguish between the two classes. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and making single predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is not included directly in the repository due to its size. Please download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cjm3LiibqObtrkn8YpRAHEw1xQpe8ZIp/view?usp=drive_link) and place it in the `dataset/` directory as follows:

- `dataset/training_set/`: Contains the training images, divided into subfolders for cats and dogs.
- `dataset/test_set/`: Contains the test images, divided into subfolders for cats and dogs.
- `dataset/single_prediction/`: Contains individual images for making single predictions.
